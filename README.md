Python scripts to make an LG TV integrate with google home etc using the Serial port on the TV And MQTT messages

At the moment I personally use this at home with On/Off messages so that I can turn off my TV via my Google Home. The Serial port can do much more but I have no need of that functionaliy for the moment so I've left it as it is. Happy if someone wants to create a PR to add more functionality!
